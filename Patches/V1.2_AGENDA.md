# AgentE v1.2 Agenda

## Goal
Make the SDK truly universal — no v0 demo artifacts, no hardcoded game assumptions, tick system configurable.

---

## 1. Tick Configuration
The developer currently controls *when* `agent.tick()` is called but cannot tell AgentE what a tick represents. We need a config option so the SDK can scale its internals (grace periods, cooldowns, metric resolutions, lag estimates) based on the developer's tick rate.

## 2. Universalize Parameter Names
All code examples and principle descriptions reference v0 demo names: `arenaEntryFee`, `craftingCost`, `arenaReward`, `healerReward`, etc. These need to become generic — `transactionFee`, `rewardRate`, `exchangeRate` — so any economy (game, DeFi, marketplace) can read the docs and see themselves.

## 3. Universalize Principle Descriptions
Principle descriptions and evidence strings reference game-specific concepts: "Fighters", "Healers", "Crafters", "Alchemists", "weapons", "potions", "arena". These need to use universal language — "roles", "agents", "resources", "markets" — while keeping the economic logic identical.

## 4. Universalize Observer Metrics
The Observer computes metrics like `timeToValue` using game-specific formulas (`20 - tick * 0.1`). Audit every metric computation to ensure nothing assumes a specific economy type.

## 5. Universalize Bootstrap Principles
The bootstrap principles (P7, P8, P9) explicitly reference "weapons", "potions", "crafters", "alchemists" and check for specific resource/role names. These need to work with whatever resource and role names the developer's economy uses.

## 6. Update Both READMEs
After all code changes, rewrite the Quick Start, Developer Controls, and any code examples in both READMEs to use the new universal parameter names.

## 7. Update Tests
All 44 tests use v0 demo state shapes. Update test fixtures to use generic names while keeping the same test logic and assertions.

## 8. Build, Test, Publish
Type-check, build, run all tests, npm publish as `@agent-e/core@1.2.0`.

## Not In Scope
- New principles (that's v1.3+)
- New adapters or demo apps
- Website redesign (landing.html / principles.html content changes can follow separately)
